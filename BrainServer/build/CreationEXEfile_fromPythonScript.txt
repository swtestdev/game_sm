Creaton python script/app as the EXE that will contains all the enviremnt and doesn't require the ENV pre-setup:

To create an executable (.exe) file from a Python project, you can use a tool like PyInstaller.
 Here’s a step-by-step guide:
1. First, install PyInstaller via pip:
bash
Copy code --> pip install pyinstaller
2. Prepare Your Python Script, Ensure your Python script works as expected.
The entry point of your project should be a single .py file, like main.py.
3. Generate the Executable
Run PyInstaller from the command line with the following command:
bash
Copy code --> pyinstaller --onefile main.py
Key Options:
--onefile: Packages everything into a single .exe file.
--noconsole: (Optional) If your program has a graphical interface and you don’t want the console window to appear.
bash
Copy code --> pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py
Example Command:
If your script is named app.py, use: pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole app.py
4. Locate the Output
After running PyInstaller, a folder named "dist" will be created in your project directory.
Inside "dist" folder, you’ll find the main.exe file (or app.exe, depending on your script name).
5. Additional Customization
You can include custom icons, hidden imports, or specify other settings.

Add an Icon:
Prepare an .ico file (e.g., myicon.ico).
Use the --icon option:
bash
Copy code -->  pyinstaller --onefile --icon=myicon.ico main.py

Include Additional Files:
If your project uses non-Python files (e.g., configuration files, images, etc.), you can specify them using the --add-data option:
bash
Copy code --> pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "data.txt;." main.py
On Windows, separate paths with a semicolon (;).
On Linux/Mac, use a colon (:).

6. Troubleshooting Common Issues
Large File Size: The .exe includes a Python interpreter and dependencies, making it larger.
Missing Modules: Use the --hidden-import option if PyInstaller fails to detect some dependencies:
bash
Copy code --> pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import=module_name main.py
7. Testing the .exe File
Run the .exe file in the "dist" folder to test it.
